description: "MUST be loaded when setting up, migrating, or auditing CLAUDE.md files in projects. Covers installing the standard CLAUDE.md into new projects, migrating existing CLAUDE.md content to READMEs (progressive disclosure), and auditing projects for conformance. Invoke PROACTIVELY when user mentions CLAUDE.md, project setup, agent configuration, or code meta files."

<essential_principles>
The goal is a small, focused CLAUDE.md that loads into every conversation while project-specific details live in README.md files throughout the codebase. This follows the progressive disclosure principle: essential instructions load immediately, domain knowledge loads just-in-time.

**1. CLAUDE.md is for agent behaviour, not project knowledge**
CLAUDE.md defines HOW the agent should work: communication style, workflow patterns, task management, definition of done. It does NOT contain project-specific technical details—those belong in README.md files.

**2. README.md files are the knowledge graph**
Each package/directory can have a README.md with domain-specific context. Agents read these just-in-time when working in that area. This keeps initial context lean while making deep knowledge available.

**3. Tests are the documentation**
Long-lived markdown should cover architecture and principles only. Detailed behaviour documentation belongs in executable tests. If behaviour isn't tested, it's not guaranteed.

**4. CLAUDE.md is not customised**
The standard CLAUDE.md (`standard/CLAUDE.md`) should be copied exactly into projects. It is designed to work universally. All project-specific content belongs in README.md files.

<intake>
What would you like to do?

1. **Install** — Set up the standard CLAUDE.md in a new project
2. **Migrate** — Refactor an existing CLAUDE.md, moving content to READMEs
3. **Audit** — Check if a project follows progressive disclosure principles

**Wait for response before proceeding.**
</intake>

<routing>
| Response | Next Action | Workflow |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| 1, "install", "setup", "new", "create" | Confirm project path | workflows/install.md |
| 2, "migrate", "refactor", "move", "convert" | Analyze existing CLAUDE.md | workflows/migrate.md |
| 3, "audit", "check", "review", "assess" | Scan project structure | workflows/audit.md |

**Intent-based routing:**
- "set up CLAUDE.md", "add agent config" → workflows/install.md
- "CLAUDE.md is too big", "slim down", "refactor" → workflows/migrate.md
- "is this right?", "check conformance" → workflows/audit.md

**After reading the workflow, follow it exactly.**
</routing>

<quick_reference>
**CLAUDE.md**: Copy `standard/CLAUDE.md` exactly. Do not modify.

**README.md distribution:**
```

All in `workflows/`:

| Workflow | Purpose |

| migrate.md | Migrate existing CLAUDE.md content to READMEs |
| audit.md | Audit project for progressive disclosure conformance |
</workflows_index>

<success_criteria>
A well-configured project:

- CLAUDE.md is an exact copy of `standard/CLAUDE.md`
- README.md at project root with overview and navigation
- Package-level README.md files for domain-specific context
- Tests document behaviour, not markdown files
</success_criteria>
